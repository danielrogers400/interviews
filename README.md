# Project Description
A simple Java 21 Spring-based web application which exposes two endpoints:

- localhost:8080/api/info
- localhost:8080/api/payments

During your interview you will be pairing with an engineer and making modifications to this 
codebase. To be prepared for this, please ensure the following:
* You have the code opened in your preferred IDE and are ready to share your screen
* The code compiles, and the application starts
* You are able to make requests to the endpoints listed above using your 
preferred method (e.g. Postman, curl, IntelliJ HTTP requests, etc.)

Best of luck!
